# VCD

**[Documentation](https://docs.rs/vcd)** | **[Changelog](https://github.com/kevinmehall/rust-vcd/releases)**

This crate reads and writes [VCD (Value Change Dump)][wp] files, a common format used with logic analyzers, HDL simulators, and other EDA tools. It provides streaming wrappers around the `io::Read` and `io::Write` traits to read and write VCD commands and data.
